  "content": "\nGreat-power competition in the 21st century increasingly\ninvolves the use of cyber operations between rival states. But do\ncyber operations achieve their stated objectives? What are the\nescalation risks? Under what conditions could increasingly frequent\nand sophisticated cyber operations result in inadvertent escalation\nand the use of military force? The answers to these questions\nshould inform U.S. cyber­security policy and strategy.\nIn the context of recent shifts in cybersecurity policy in the\nUnited States, this paper examines the character of cyber conflict\nthrough time. Data on cyber actions from 2000 to 2016 demonstrate\nevidence of a restrained domain with few aggressive attacks that\nseek a dramatic, decisive impact. Attacks do not beget attacks, nor\ndo they deter them. But if few operations are effective in\ncompelling the enemy and fewer still lead to responses in the\ndomain, why would a policy of offensive operations to deter rival\nstates be useful in cyberspace?\nWe demonstrate that, while cyber operations to date have not\nbeen escalatory or particularly effective in achieving decisive\noutcomes, recent policy changes and strategy pronouncements by the\nTrump administration increase the risk of escalation while doing\nnothing to make cyber operations more effective. These changes\nrevolve around a dangerous myth: offense is an effective and easy\nway to stop rival states from hacking America. New policies for\nauthorizing preemptive offensive cyber strategies risk crossing a\nthreshold and changing the rules of the game.\nCyberspace to date has been a domain of political warfare and\ncoercive diplomacy. An offensively postured cyber policy is\ndangerous, counterproductive, and undermines norms in cyberspace.\nMany have promoted the idea of a coming “Cyber Pearl\nHarbor,” but instead the domain is littered with covert\noperations meant to manage escalation and deter future attacks.\nCyber strategy and policy must start from an accurate understanding\nof the domain, not imagined realities.\nSenior leaders throughout the federal government should consider\na more prudent and restrained approach to cyber operations. We\nargue for a defensive posture consisting of limited cyber\noperations aimed at restraining rivals and avoiding escalation. At\nthe same time, the United States should focus on protective\nmeasures to make U.S. systems less vulnerable and on sharing\nintelligence with allies and partners. A policy of restraint that\nmaintains control over the weapons of cyber war is strategically\nwise.\n"
