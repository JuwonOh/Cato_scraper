  "content": "\nOpioid overdose deaths have risen dramatically in the United\nStates over the past two decades. The standard explanation blames\nexpanded prescribing and advertising of opioids beginning in the\n1990s.\nThis “more prescribing, more deaths” explanation has\nspurred increased legal restrictions on opioid prescribing. Federal\nand state governments have enacted a variety of policies to curtail\nprescribing and doctor shopping, and the federal government has\nraided pain management facilities deemed to be overprescribing.\nSupporters believe these policies reduce the supply of prescription\nopioids and thereby decrease overdose deaths.\nWe find little support for this view. We instead suggest that\nthe opioid epidemic has resulted from too many restrictions on\nprescribing, not too few. Rather than decreasing opioid overdose\ndeaths, restrictions push users from prescription opioids toward\ndiverted or illicit opioids, which increases the risk of overdose\nbecause consumers cannot easily assess drug potency or quality in\nunderground markets. The implication of this “more\nrestrictions, more deaths” explanation is that the United\nStates should scale back restrictions on opioid prescribing,\nperhaps to the point of legalization.\n",
