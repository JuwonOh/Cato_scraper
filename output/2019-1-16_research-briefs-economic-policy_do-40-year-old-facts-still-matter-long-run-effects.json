  "content": "\nThe Voting Rights Act (VRA) of 1965 has been hailed as one of\nthe “greatest legislative achievements of the Civil Rights\nMovement.” Passed months after the Selma to Montgomery\nmarches, the Act prohibited the denial or abridgement of “the\nright to vote on account of race or color.” The effects of\nthe VRA on minority enfranchisement were immediate. Between the\n1964 and 1968 presidential elections, black voter registration\nrates increased 67 percent among Southern states.\nThe Act achieved this through two principal mechanisms. The\nfirst was the prohibition of literacy tests, which were used\nthroughout the Jim Crow era to disenfranchise Southern blacks.\nSection 5 of the VRA established a second and more controversial\nmechanism: a federal oversight process commonly referred to as\n“preclearance.” Jurisdictions subject to preclearance\n(henceforth called “covered jurisdictions”) were\nprohibited from implementing any new electoral rule without first\nobtaining federal approval. While preclearance’s geographic\npurview was limited only to areas that met certain historical\ncriteria, the scope of its protections was expansive and\nencompassed all future changes affecting voting in those areas.\nThus, preclearance restrictions, which have been called “the\nmost effective means of preventing racial bias in voting,”\nwere designed as a broad prophylaxis against voter discrimination,\nshifting onto covered jurisdictions the burden of proving ex\nante that new voting rules did not have a\n“discriminatory purpose” and would not have a\n“discriminatory effect.”\nSince its inception, preclearance oversight has been alternately\npraised and criticized as “extraordinary legislation\notherwise unfamiliar to our federal system.” These arguments\ncame to a head in 2013 in Shelby County v. Holder, in\nwhich the Supreme Court ruled that continued coverage based on\nhistorical—rather than current—measures of\ndiscrimination is unconstitutional. As a result, until and unless\nCongress enacts a new coverage formula, previously covered\njurisdictions are no longer subject to federal oversight.\nImmediately following the Shelby ruling, lawmakers in several\npreviously covered areas enacted controversial new voting changes,\nmany of which have been challenged in federal courts. Alabama,\nMississippi, North Carolina, and Texas introduced restrictive voter\nID requirements, while Florida, Georgia, and Virginia sought to\npurge their voter rolls of thousands of eligible minorities. Though\nRepublicans have justified these measures as necessary to combat\nwidespread voter fraud, Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer denounced\nthem as a “clear front for constricting the access to vote\n[for] poor Americans … African-Americans and Latinos.”\nUnderpinning this partisan divide is the common belief that the\nminorities most impacted by restrictive voting rules lean heavily\nDemocratic. Indeed, President Donald Trump claimed that, of the\n“millions” of allegedly illegal ballots cast in 2016,\n“none of ’em come to me. They would all be for the\nother side.” Given America’s growing minority\nelectorate, the legal fate of these voting laws could have lasting\nimplications for future elections.\nDespite their relevance to ongoing policy debates, the specific\neffects of preclearance have never been estimated. While\nresearchers have examined the VRA’s impact on turnout and\nrepresentation, these studies focus on the 1965 implementation of\nthe Act and are thus unable to disentangle the effects of\npreclearance from the simultaneous abolition of literacy tests,\nwhich were among the most discriminatory tools ever employed in the\nU.S. election system and are unlikely to ever be reinstated.\nFurthermore, those studies as well as the broader literature on\nenfranchisement focus on policies designed to alleviate specific,\nexisting barriers to voting—such as the elimination of\nliteracy tests or the expansion of suffrage rights.\nPreclearance restrictions differ fundamentally from these\ninterventions. Rather than targeting individual voting barriers\nalready in use, federal oversight was designed to restrict the\nimplementation of any and all new discriminatory measures.\nUnderstanding the implications of these blanket protections is\nespecially relevant considering the strategic manipulations that\nlocal election officials engage in to maintain power. Broad\npreventative oversight encompassing the universe of potential\nvoting changes may be the most effective means of curbing\ndiscrimination in the United States, where electoral rule-making is\nhighly decentralized and opaque.\nMy research seeks to better understand the effects of such\noversight. I examine the geographic expansion of coverage under the\n1975 revision of the VRA to estimate the causal impact of\npreclearance on county-level voter turnout and Democratic vote\nshare from 1960 to 2016. Unlike the 1965 VRA, which was reverse\nengineered by Congress to target Southern states that employed\nliteracy tests, the 1975 coverage formula relied on noisy measures\nof voter turnout and minority population share to determine which\ncounties were subject to preclearance. Thus, application of the\n1975 formula resulted in heterogeneity of coverage within states\nthroughout the country, subjecting 283 counties across nine states\nto federal oversight. I am able to exploit this heterogeneity to\nprecisely estimate the policy’s effects and to demonstrate\nits plausible exogeneity.\nI find that preclearance restrictions led to gradual and\nsignificant increases in voter participation and that these gains\npersisted for over 40 years, bolstering turnout by 4 to 8\npercentage points in recent elections. Examining state-level\nturnout by race, I demonstrate that these effects were due entirely\nto increased participation among minorities, who were 30 percent\nmore likely to vote in the 2012 election as a result of federal\noversight. Analyzing electoral rules data, I show that\nmunicipalities subject to voter protections were significantly less\nlikely to employ “winner-take-all” election systems,\nwhich are commonly believed to dilute minority voting power.\nCombined with heterogeneity analysis demonstrating larger effects\namong areas with greater historical discrimination, these results\nsuggest that gains in turnout were the result of reduced voter\ndiscrimination as opposed to other demographic or political\nfactors.\nSurprisingly, I find that preclearance coverage led to\nsignificant and immediate decreases in the share of Democratic\nvotes cast. These estimates are large—averaging 3.2\npercentage points across post-treatment elections—and exceed\nthe 1992 and 1996 presidential margins of victory in the covered\nstates of Texas and Arizona. Using historical survey data, I show\nthat this rightward shift was driven by increased Republican\nsupport among whites. In particular, whites who were opposed to the\nCivil Rights movement were 30 percent more likely to identify as\nRepublican following the implementation of preclearance in their\ncounties. In further demonstration of the political controversy\nsurrounding these measures, I find that newspaper mentions of the\nVRA spiked sharply in covered areas beginning in 1975, particularly\namong those papers that had endorsed President Richard Nixon, whose\nRepublican administration had sought to abolish preclearance. Taken\ntogether, these results provide strong evidence that the enactment\nof minority voter protections triggered a massive political\nrealignment among the white electorate.\nFinally, to investigate the ramifications of the Supreme\nCourt’s 2013 decision to overturn preclearance, I examine\nreturns from the 2016 presidential election. I find that areas that\nwere newly freed from federal oversight experienced a significant\ndecrease in turnout of 1.5 percentage points, the single largest\nyear-to-year drop in the 40-year sample period. While white turnout\nin these areas remained unchanged, minority participation dropped\nby nearly 4 percent. These results bolster claims regarding the\ndiscriminatory nature of recent election law changes and provide\nearly evidence that the Shelby ruling may jeopardize decades of\nvoting rights progress.\nIn the majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts struck down\npreclearance on the grounds that “a [coverage] formula based\non 40-year-old facts” has “no logical relation to the\npresent day.” In contrast, I find evidence not only that\npreclearance coverage led to increases in minority participation\nthat persisted for more than four decades, but also that these\ngains were quickly eroded after its rescission. To the extent that\nthe future of the VRA hinges on the formulation of new coverage\ncriteria relevant to the “present day,” understanding\nthese effects and the role they played in shaping the current\npolitical landscape is critical to Congress’ ability to craft\nmeaningful legislation capable of ensuring the voting rights of\nAmerican citizens.\nNOTE:\nThis research brief is based on Desmond Ang, “Do 40-YearOld\nFacts Still Matter?
