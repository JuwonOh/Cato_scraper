In the past half century, for\nexample, Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) statements were added\nas a requirement in the Code of Federal Regulations, and nearly\nevery U.S. employer has grappled with how to provide equal\nopportunities. Even with such policies and affirmative action\nprograms in place, racial inequalities remain ubiquitous in labor\nmarkets. Relative to whites, blacks in the United States are twice\nas likely to be unemployed and earn 20 percent less or lower. A\ncritic of EEO regulations might interpret such data patterns as\nstark evidence of a policy gone awry, whereas a supporter of EEO\nregulations might view such data under an optimistic lens, noting\nthat such comparisons would be even more highly skewed absent the\nsweeping EEO policies enacted in the 20th century.\nRather than turning back the clock and examining how EEO\nregulations in totality have influenced labor-market patterns over\nthe past several decades, we present initial insights into how an\nimportant element of EEO regulations affects labor markets today.\nIn this sense, we aim to provide initial empirical evidence on how\nEEO statements currently affect racial minorities and their\nlabor-market choices. Such an exercise is important for several\nreasons. First, several states and the U.S. federal government\nrequire EEO statements in job advertisements. Second, aside from\nthese cases, employers have to decide whether they want to include\nan EEO statement in their job advertisement. Third, many public and\nprivate employers in the United States and elsewhere still use EEO\nstatements in job advertisements. Fourth, there are broad\nrecommendations and regulations surrounding their inclusion.\nFinally, because racial minorities remain disadvantaged in many\nlabor markets, it is of utmost importance to evaluate common\npractices and policies that aim to reduce labor-market\ninequalities. To our best knowledge, causal estimates of actual EEO\nstatements do not exist despite their pervasiveness and arguments\nthat they could discourage minorities.\nWe use a large-scale natural field experiment aimed at exploring\nthe causal impact of EEO statements in job advertisements to\nprovide a first step into understanding the effects of EEO policy.\nTo investigate how EEO statements affect the job-applicant pool, we\nadvertise real jobs and investigate more than 2,300 job-entry\ndecisions across various labor-market settings. Our working\nhypothesis is that EEO statements encourage minorities to apply for\na job. Our experiment renders it possible to investigate\ninteresting heterogeneities because we post the job advertisements\nin 10 large U.S. cities with substantially different racial\ncompositions.\nWe find that EEO statements do affect job-entry decisions.\nHowever, the statement that all job applicants receive equal\nconsideration irrespective of race leads to unexpected outcomes. In\nparticular, we find that EEO statements discourage racial\nminorities from applying for jobs in important ways. Educated\nnonwhites are less likely to apply if the job description includes\nan EEO statement, and the discouragement effect is particularly\npronounced in cities with white-majority populations. The impact of\nEEO statements on job applications from minorities is economically\nsignificant because their application likelihood drops by up to 30\npercent.\nTo explore the underlying mechanism at work, we conduct\ncomplementary surveys with job seekers drawn from the same subject\npool. We find that the inclusion of EEO statements significantly\naffects anticipated discrimination, stereotype threat, and\ntokenism. That is, we observe that the inclusion of the EEO\nstatement in the studied job advertisements decreases the\nlikelihood with which job seekers anticipate discrimination during\nhiring and career advancement and that it lowers stereotype threat.\nAt the same time, however, we observe that the inclusion of the EEO\nstatement significantly increases the perception of tokenism. This\neffect is particularly pronounced in cities with white-majority\npopulations, where more than two thirds of job seekers believe that\nthe inclusion of the EEO statement signals that there will be token\nhires.\nOur survey findings augment the field experimental results and\nprovide insights into the mechanism underlying the observed\ndiscouragement effect of EEO statements. They suggest that racial\nminorities prefer not to apply for jobs where there is a high\nlikelihood that they are token hires. These tokenism concerns are\nso strong that they outweigh other desirable effects of EEO\nstatements, such as lower anticipated discrimination and stereotype\nthreat.\nCombined with the insights from Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil\nMullainathan and from Sonia Kang, Katherine DeCelles, András\nTilcsik, and Sora Jun, who report that employers who use EEO\nstatements are not less likely to discriminate against racial\nminorities, our findings paint a rather bleak picture of current\nEEO policies aimed to have a positive impact on minority\nlabor-market representation. This does not imply that EEO\nstatements have never had their intended effects, that EEO policies\nrequiring the mandatory inclusion of EEO statements across the\nboard cannot have their intended effects, or that differently\nformulated statements cannot have their intended effects. Rather,\nthe results suggest that there is little support for the inclusion\nof standard EEO statements in job ads in today’s labor market and\neven evidence that important deleterious effects arise from such\nstatements.\nNOTE:\nThis research brief is based on Andreas Leibbrandt and John A.List,\n“Do Equal Employment Opportunity Statements Backfire?Evidence\nfrom a Natural Field Experiment on Job-Entry Decisions,”NBER\nWorking Paper No. 25035, September 2018, http://www.nber.org/papers/w25035.\n",
