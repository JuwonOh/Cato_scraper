Predictions of the impact of the minimum wage in\nsearch-and-matching models of the labor market depend heavily on\nendogenous search effort responses. In these models, the increased\ncost of hiring can be offset by the supply side in which workers\nsearch more and longer, leading to better job matches. Indeed, this\nis one of the primary reasons posited for the lack of employment\nresponse to minimum wage increases sometimes seen in the empirical\nliterature.\nWe investigate the effect of minimum wage increases on job\nsearch effort using data from the Current Population Survey (CPS),\nthe American Time Use Survey (ATUS), and the Survey of Income and\nProgram Participation (SIPP). We exploit the staggered nature of\nCPS, ATUS, and SIPP interviews and use an event-study approach,\nleveraging within state variation in the adoption of minimum wage\nchanges.\nWe account for shocks affecting a particular state in a given\nyear, month effects to control for seasonality, and individual\ndemographic characteristics. In the SIPP, we repeat observations on\nthe same individuals to account for unobserved time-invariant\nindividual characteristics. Intuitively, we compare the outcomes in\neach month near the treatment date to the outcomes for otherwise\nidentical individuals in the same state and year whose survey\nperiod was not near a treatment date.\nWe find no evidence that the minimum wage has persistent effects\non search effort; the likelihood of searching does not increase in\nthe aftermath of minimum wage increases. However, there is a large\nyet transitory increase in the intensive margin of search effort,\nconcentrated in the month of the minimum wage increase, that fades\nalmost immediately. There is no short-run increase in the\nemployment rate, and there are no changes in observable\ncharacteristics of searchers, suggesting that our results are not\ndriven by changes in the number or composition of job seekers.\nThese findings are robust to the inclusion of demographic controls,\nthe duration of unemployment benefits, month-by-year fixed effects\nthat account for any idiosyncratic national-level variation in a\ngiven month, and individual fixed effects in the SIPP. We also\nconduct a permutation test for our search duration results in which\nwe randomly assign minimum wage increases across time periods and\nshow that these results do not appear to be due to chance.\nOur results call into question the assumption underpinning\nsearch-and-matching models as applied to analysis of the minimum\nwage—namely, that more workers will enter the labor market\nand each worker will search harder, increasing the returns to firm\nvacancy postings. Importantly, we find that minimum wage increases\ndo not induce individuals to begin searching. Although we find that\nminimum wage increases yield significant increases in worker search\neffort on the intensive margin, those effects are transitory.\nThis effect, although not predicted by standard labor theory,\nhas been documented in a similar setting. Alan Krueger and Andreas\nMueller find that job search responses to unemployment benefit\nexhaustion are transitory. Specifically, they document that\nindividuals increase their search effort just before unemployment\nbenefits expire, but that effort declines to previous levels soon\nafter unemployment insurance benefits are exhausted. Our findings\nsimilarly suggest that the search responses to the increased value\nof obtaining a job may be short-lived.\nUnderstanding the impact of the minimum wage on different\naspects of the labor market, rather than simply on equilibrium\nemployment outcomes, is of significant importance given its\nincreasing prevalence as a policy instrument. Our findings suggest\nthe need for greater analysis of not only job search behavior after\na minimum wage change but also other supply-side responses.\nNOTE:\nThis research brief is based on Camilla Adams, Jonathan Meer, and\nCarlyWill Sloan, “The Minimum Wage and Search Effort,”\nNBER Working Paper No. 25128, October 2018, http://www.nber.org/papers/w25128.\n",
