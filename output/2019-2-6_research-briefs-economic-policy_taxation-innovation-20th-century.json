  "content": "\nMajor reforms to the US tax code under the 2017 Tax Cuts and\nJobs Act has renewed interest in the longstanding question—\ndo taxes affect innovation? If innovation is the result of\nintentional effort, and if taxes reduce the expected net return,\nthen the answer should be yes. Yet, when we think of path-breaking,\nsuperstar inventors from history such as Wallace Carothers\n(DuPont), Edwin Land (Polaroid), or William Shockley (Bell Labs and\nShockley Semiconductor), we often imagine hard-working and driven\nscientists who ignore financial incentives and merely seek\nintellectual achievement. More generally, if taxes affect the\namount of innovation, do they also affect the quality of the\ninnovations produced? Do they affect where inventors decide to\nlocate and what firms they work for? Do they affect where companies\nallocate Research and Development (R&D) resources and how many\nresearchers they employ?\nAnswers to these questions, while crucial to a clearer\nunderstanding of a vexing current policy issue, have remained\nelusive due to a paucity of empirical evidence. In fact, in the\nabsence of systematic data, ambivalence toward tax policy may stem\nfrom a reliance on isolated cases or anecdotes to confirm or reject\nparticular viewpoints. The gap in our knowledge is especially large\nwhen trying to understand the impact of tax policy on technological\ndevelopment over the long run. Although the United States\nexperienced major changes in its tax code throughout the 20th\ncentury, we currently do not know how these tax changes influenced\ninnovation at either the individual, corporate, or state\nlevels.\nWe both bridge the data gap and provide new evidence on the\neffects of taxation on innovation. Our goal is to systematically\nanalyze the effects of both personal and corporate income taxation\non inventors, as well as on firms that did R&D during the 20th\ncentury. To our knowledge, this has never been done before because\nof the lack of data. Our analysis leverages three new datasets.\nFirst, we construct a panel dataset on inventors based on digitized\nhistorical patent data since 1920. These panel data allow us to\ntrack inventors over time and observe their innovations, citations,\nplaces of residence, technological fields, and the firm (if any) to\nwhich they assigned their patents. Second, we build a dataset on\nfirms’ R&D activities over the 20th century, specifically the\nnumber of laboratories operated and research employment. These data\nwere obtained from National Research Council Surveys of Industrial\nResearch Laboratories of the United States for the period\n1921-1970.\nThird, we combine the new inventor-level panel data and\nfirm-level R&D data with a new dataset on historical statelevel\ncorporate income taxes and a database on personal income tax rates.\nThe corporate tax data were compiled from a range of handbooks and\nreference works. The result of this extensive data collection\neffort is a comprehensive historical dataset covering individual\ninventors, R&D labs and research workers of firms, and taxation\nat the corporate and personal levels for much of the 20th century\nin the United States. Due to the richness of our data, we can\nanalyze the impact of taxes on innovation for both individuals and\nfirms.\nWe provide a conceptual framework to help motivate our analysis\nand interpret the various effects of taxes on innovation that we\nidentify. This framework has the following intuition: Consider an\ninnovation production function in which the quantity and quality of\ninnovation result from costly investments in research expenses and\neffort. Inventors can work for firms or be self-employed. Personal\nand corporate income taxes affect the net return to innovation.\nSince innovation inputs are costly, they exhibit elasticities to\nnet returns, the magnitudes of which will depend on the market\nenvironment. If inventors work for firms, for example, their\ncompensation derives from surplus sharing with the firm. As a\nresult, both firms and their inventors could be responsive to both\npersonal and corporate income taxes. These effects, in turn, may\nreflect a mix of extensive margin responses (inventors or firms\nmoving across states, and individuals making occupational choices\nand entering or exiting the labor market) and intensive margin\nresponses (inventors choosing how hard to work on their research,\nor companies choosing how many employees to hire).\nWe begin by describing patterns in innovation and taxation over\nthe 20th century. We focus on key facts in relation to inventors,\nmaking use of the new panel data to show where inventors located\nover time, where firms’ R&D labs were placed, and trends\nexhibited by the time series of patents, citations, and research\nlab employment. We then document central patterns in taxation on\npersonal and corporate income over the 20th century in the US,\nfocusing specifically on our newly constructed corporate tax\ndatabase.\nNext, we focus on macro state-level results. We study the\nbaseline relationship between taxes and innovation, exploiting\nwithin-state tax changes over time and differences across borders.\nOn the personal income tax side, we consider average and marginal\ntax rates, both for the median income level and for top earners.\nOur corporate tax measure is the top corporate tax rate. We find\nthat personal and corporate income taxes have significant effects\nat the state level on patents, citations, inventors, and\n“superstar” inventors in the state, and the share of\npatents produced by firms as opposed to individuals. The implied\nelasticities of patents, inventors, and citations at the macro\nlevel are between 2 and 3.4 for personal income taxes and between\n2.5 and 3.5 for the corporate tax. We show that these effects\ncannot be fully accounted for by inventors moving across state\nlines, and therefore do not merely reflect “zero-sum”\nbusiness-stealing of one state from other states.\nWe then turn to the micro level which consists of individual\nfirms and inventors. In addition to many detailed inventor-level\ncontrols, we exploit within state-year variation. We make use of\nthe fact that inventors of different productivities have different\nincomes and will therefore be subject to different tax brackets.\nAgain, we find that taxes have significant negative effects on the\nquantity and quality (as measured by citations) of patents produced\nby inventors, including on the likelihood of producing a highly\nsuccessful patent (which gathers many citations). At the individual\ninventor level, the elasticity of patents to the personal income\ntax is 0.6-0.7, and the elasticity of citations is 0.8-0.9.\nFurthermore, we show that individual inventors are negatively\naffected by the corporate tax rate, but much less so than by\npersonal income taxes. Corporate inventors are much more elastic to\npersonal and corporate income taxes than noncorporate inventors\n(individual “garage” inventors operating outside the\nboundaries of firms), and are especially strongly elastic to the\ncorporate tax rate. We also show that an inventor is less sensitive\nto taxes when there is more agglomeration— that is, more\ninventors in the same technological field in the state. At the\nindividual firm level, we find that corporate taxes— and, to\na lesser extent, personal income taxes—have significant\nnegative effects on the level of patents, citations, and research\nworkers employed in corporate R&D laboratories.\nFinally, we estimate a location choice model in which inventors\ncan choose in which state to reside, trading off state\ncharacteristics against the effective tax rate in each state. We\nfind that inventors are significantly less likely to locate in\nstates with higher taxes. The elasticity to the net-of-tax rate of\nthe number of inventors residing in a state is 0.11 for inventors\nwho are from that state and 1.23 for inventors not from that state.\nInventors who work for companies are particularly elastic to taxes.\nAgglomeration effects appear to matter for location as well:\ninventors are less sensitive to taxation in a potential destination\nstate when there is already more innovation in that state in their\nparticular field of inventive activity. This is also true if an\ninventor’s employer already has a record of innovation activity in\nthat state. We confirm that firms are responsive to corporate taxes\nwhen they choose where to locate by estimating a location choice\nmodel at the individual R&D lab level.\nOur main findings can therefore be summarized as follows:\nTaxation—in the form of both personal income taxes and\ncorporate income taxes—matters for innovation along the\nintensive and extensive margins, and both at the micro and macro\nlevels. Taxes affect the amount of innovation, the quality of\ninnovation, and the location of inventive activity. The effects are\neconomically large, especially at the macro state level where\ncross-state spillovers, extensive margin location, and entry\ndecisions compound the micro, individual-level elasticities. Not\nall the effects of taxes at the macro level are accounted for by\ncross-state business stealing or spillovers. Corporate inventors\nare most sensitive to taxation, and positive agglomeration effects\nplay an important role, perhaps by offering a type of compensating\ndifferential for taxation.\nNOTE:\nThis research brief is based on Ufuk Akcigit, John Grigsby, Tom\nNicholas, and Stefanie Stantcheva, “Taxation and Innovation in\nthe 20th Century,” NBER Working Paper no. 24982, September\n2018, http://www.nber.org/papers/w24982.\n"
