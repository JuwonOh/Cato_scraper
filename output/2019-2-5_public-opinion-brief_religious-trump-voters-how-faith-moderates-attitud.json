  "content": "Increasing political polarization and rising conflict over\nidentity, race relations, immigration, and LGBT rights have left\ntwo increasingly divided extremes with a seemingly elusive moderate\nmiddle.1 Many have come to view religious\ninstitutions, largely because of their opposition to same-sex\nmarriage, as a major contributor to this ever-increasing divide\n— a catalyst for increased intergroup societal conflict\nrather than a possible cure. However, research from the Democracy\nFund Voter Study Group’s VOTER Surveys (Views of the Electorate\nResearch Survey) finds that religious participation may serve as a\nmoderating function in our politics, particularly among\nconservatives.2 These national surveys find that Donald\nTrump voters who attend church regularly are more likely than\nnonreligious Trump voters to have warmer feelings toward racial and\nreligious minorities, to be more supportive of immigration and\ntrade, and to be more concerned about poverty. These data are\nimportant because they demonstrate that private institutions in\ncivil society can have a positive effect on social conflict and can\nreduce polarization.\nLeft-right culture wars over the rights of LGBT (lesbian, gay,\nbisexual, and transsexual) people — particularly government\nsanction of same-sex marriages — have likely soured many\nDemocrats’ views of Christians. Indeed, a majority (56 percent) of\nDemocrats report unfavorable feelings toward evangelical\nChristians.3 This, in large part, may be a response\nto the 64 percent of churchgoing Christians who oppose legalized\nsame-sex marriage and the half who have cool feelings toward LGBT\npeople, and to the finding that the more frequently people attend\nchurch, the more negative their attitudes are likely to be toward\ngay men, lesbians, and also feminists. Thus, antagonism toward\nreligious institutions is often grounded in the idea that religion\nis a source of exclusion and oppression rather than of inclusivity\nand tolerance. Such views are succinctly articulated by a bumper\nsticker from the Richard Dawkins Foundation: “There is no war on\nreligion: Only opposition of intolerance, oppression, hatred, and\nstupidity.”\n\nIt may surprise some readers, however, to learn that religious\nparticipation may moderate conservatives’ attitudes on other\nimportant culture war issues, particularly matters of race,\nimmigration, and identity. Given that the rise of Donald Trump has\nincreased the salience of these issues, this brief uses the 2016,\n2017, and 2018 VOTER Surveys to examine how religious and\nnonreligious people who voted for Donald Trump think about these\nimportant issues.4\nContinue to full version\nConservatives’ views of black people, Hispanics, and Asians\nimprove the more frequently conservatives attend religious\nservices. Specifically, favorable feelings toward black people\nincrease from 48 percent among Trump voters who never attend church\nto 73 percent among those who attend more than once a week —\na 25-point increase. Similarly, favorable feelings toward Hispanics\nand Asians increase from 63 percent and 60 percent, respectively,\namong secular Trump voters to 72 percent and 80 percent,\nrespectively, among churchgoing Trump voters.\n\nFrequent conservative churchgoers also say they care more about\nracial equality. More than two-thirds (67 percent) of churchgoing\nconservatives say racial equality is an important issue to them\npersonally. In contrast, 51 percent of nonreligious conservatives\nsay racial equality is not an\nimportant issue.\n\nConservatives’ own racial identity also becomes less salient to\nthem the more frequently they attend church. Indeed, nonreligious\nwhite Trump voters are about three times as likely as churchgoing\nwhite Trump voters to say their white racial identity is “extremely\nimportant” to them (26 percent vs. 9 percent).\n\nReduced emphasis on their own racial identity might contribute\nto the finding that conservative churchgoers are less concerned\nabout future prospects of a so-called majority-minority nation.\nWhile 6 in 10 churchgoing Trump voters agree that demographic\nchange will enrich American society, less than half (47 percent) of\nsecular Trump voters agree.\nTrump voters’ attitudes toward religious minorities, including\nJewish and Muslim Americans, also warm according to church\nattendance.\nFor instance, very devout Trump voters are 17 percentage points\nmore likely than nonreligious Trump voters to have favorable\nfeelings toward Jews (85 percent vs. 68 percent).\n\nAlthough Trump voters’ views of Muslims follow a similar\npattern, attitudes across the board are less favorable and have\nshifted downward since 2016.\nIn the 2016 VOTER Survey, churchgoing Trump voters were nearly\ntwice as likely as secular Trump voters to have favorable feelings\ntoward Muslims (27 percent vs. 16 percent). Trump voters who attend\nchurch frequently were also less enthusiastic about implementing a\ntemporary ban on Muslims immigrating to the United States. At the\ntime, very frequent churchgoers were 20 percentage points less\nlikely than secular Trump voters to “strongly” favor a temporary\ntravel ban on Muslims entering the United States (34 percent vs. 54\npercent).5\n\nHowever, after President Trump issued several executive orders\nrestricting travel to the United States, opinions changed. The 2017\nVOTER Survey found that churchgoing Trump voters were about as\nlikely as secular Trump voters to have warm feelings (14 percent\nvs. 16 percent) toward Muslims. Strong support for the travel ban\nalso increased across the board, but frequent churchgoers remained\nless enthusiastic than secular Trump voters (58 percent vs. 67\npercent reported that they “strongly favor” the travel ban). Still,\nthe gap narrowed to nine percentage points between nonreligious and\nreligious Trump voters. These data indicate that, at least on some\nissues, partisanship and a desire to follow the party’s leader may\ndiminish the possible moderating effects of religious\nparticipation.\nDespite increased support for the travel ban, majorities of\nTrump voters, regardless of religious observance, oppose denying\nMuslims who are U.S. citizens the right to vote.6 Even so,\nchurchgoers are far more “strongly opposed” to such a restriction\nthan nonreligious Trump voters (63 percent vs. 48 percent), the\n2017 VOTER Survey found.\nConsistent with these findings, churchgoing Trump voters are\nmore likely to agree that acceptance of racial and religious\ndiversity is at the core of American identity. Eighty-three percent\nof Trump voters who attend a religious service more than once a\nweek say it is “very” or “fairly important” to accept people of\ndiverse racial and religious backgrounds to be “truly American,”\ncompared with only two-thirds (67 percent) of nonreligious Trump\nvoters — a 16 percentage-point difference.\n\nReligious participation also correlates with attitudes toward\nimmigrants and the immigration system. Churchgoing Trump voters are\nless concerned about immigration in a number of dimensions.\nTrump voters who never or rarely attend religious services are\nconsiderably more concerned about immigration and take a more\nnegative view of it than religiously observant Trump voters. While\nmore than two-thirds (67 percent) of secular Trump voters say\nimmigration is a “very important” issue, less than half (48\npercent) of very regular churchgoers agree.\n\nFurthermore, nonreligious Trump voters are nearly 20 percentage\npoints more likely than churchgoing Trump voters to oppose a\npathway to citizenship for the undocumented, to want a border wall,\nto support making the legal immigration process more arduous, and\nto believe illegal immigration drains the economy:\n\n\nThis isn’t just about policy. Secular Trump voters are also more\nbothered by interactions with non-English speakers than are\nchurchgoing Trump voters. In fact, a majority (55 percent) of Trump\nvoters who never attend church “strongly agree” that it bothers\nthem to interact with immigrants who speak little or no English. In\ncontrast, about a third of Trump voters who attend religious\nservices at least once in a while report this as a salient\nfrustration.\n\nAlthough trade is a separate issue from immigration, attitudes\nabout trade often correspond with feelings about an increasingly\ninterconnected world — which includes immigration. Indeed, we\nfind a familiar pattern in which nonreligious Trump voters are less\noptimistic about trade, compared with religious Trump voters. While\n51 percent of secular Trump voters favor increasing trade with\nother countries, two-thirds (66 percent) of churchgoing Trump\nvoters favor doing so.\n\nBut interestingly, immediately after the 2016 presidential\nelection, religious and nonreligious Trump voters had similar\nattitudes about increasing trade (just 51 percent and 47 percent of\neach group supported it, respectively). Perhaps because Trump made\ntrade a salient issue during his campaign, his supporters fell into\nline behind him. Partisanship combined with Trump’s negative\nrhetoric about trade may have equalized conservatives’ attitudes on\nthe issue regardless of religious participation. As with our\nfinding concerning attitudes on the travel ban, partisan loyalties\nmay reduce the possible moderating effects of religion on\nattitudes, at least temporarily.\nMost conservatives favor the death penalty; however, opposition\nto capital punishment rises with church attendance. Trump voters\nwho attend church very frequently are about two and a half times as\nlikely as secular Trump voters to oppose the death penalty (20\npercent vs. 8 percent). Similarly, Trump voters who are very\nfrequent churchgoers are about 20 percentage points less likely\nthan nonreligious Trump voters to think the death penalty ought to\nbe imposed more often (50 percent vs. 67 percent).\n\n\nReligious Trump voters are more concerned about poverty than are\nnonreligious Trump voters. Trump voters who attend church at least\nonce a week are nearly twice as likely as secular Trump voters to\nsay that poverty is a “very important” issue to them (42 percent\nvs. 23 percent).\n\nThis does not mean, however, that churchgoing conservatives\nfavor a larger welfare state more than secular conservatives do.\nReligiously observant and nonobservant Trump voters alike want the\nRepublican Party to prioritize reducing the size of government (83\npercent and 85 percent, respectively) and agree it is not the\nfederal government’s responsibility to ensure that everyone has\nhealth care coverage (78 percent and 73 percent, respectively). In\nfact, Trump-voting churchgoers are more likely to favor repeal of\nthe Affordable Care Act (89 percent vs. 76 percent) and to oppose\ngovernment “doing more” to reduce income differences between rich\nand poor (71 percent vs. 58 percent) than are their secular\ncounterparts. They hold these views despite both groups’ having\nfairly similar incomes (Table 1).\nSome might interpret these results to mean that religious\nconservatives only say they care about poverty because they believe\nit is socially desirable to do so but that they don’t want to take\naction with the intent to alleviate poverty. However, other data in\nthe survey suggest that religious conservatives may turn to private\nremedies rather than to more government action to help people in\nneed.\nIndeed, religious Trump voters are more likely than nonreligious\nTrump voters to do volunteer work. For instance, while 61 percent\nof very frequent churchgoers among Trump voters volunteered at\nleast once in the past 12 months, only 20 percent of secular Trump\nvoters did.7 And it wasn’t simply volunteer work with\ntheir own church. Among only those Trump voters who volunteered in\nthe past year, frequent churchgoers (62 percent) were about 30\npercentage points more likely to have volunteered with two or more\norganizations (and thus not just with their own church) than were\nsecular Trump voters (34 percent).\n\nGiven that many of these attitudinal patterns are inconsistent\nwith President Trump’s own stated views, some might wonder why\nreligious conservatives overwhelmingly voted for him in 2016.\nIndeed, exit polls found that 80 percent of evangelicals as well as\n55 percent of frequent churchgoers voted for Trump, even after\n“Hollywood Access” recordings revealed Trump bragging about his own\ninfidelity.8\n\nHowever, right after the 2016 presidential election, religiously\nobservant Trump voters were less enthusiastic about him than\nnonreligious Trump voters were. While 63 percent of secular Trump\nvoters had a “very favorable” view of Trump, a little fewer than\nhalf (49 percent) of very frequent churchgoers who voted for Trump\nagreed. Moreover, very observant Trump voters were 15 percentage\npoints more likely than nonreligious Trump voters to say their vote\nwas against Hillary Clinton\nrather than for Donald Trump\n(38 percent vs. 23 percent). Those feelings are reflected in the\nexit polling data. Trump garnered a lower share of weekly\nchurchgoers in 2016 than Mitt Romney did in 2012 (55 percent vs. 59\npercent). Instead, Trump gained ground relative to Romney among\ninfrequent churchgoers (46 percent vs. 42 percent).9\nNevertheless, strong majorities of Trump voters with varying rates\nof religious participation continue to have positive views of the\npresident.\nExamining the primary voting choices of Trump’s general election\nvoters reveals a consistent pattern. Religious conservatives were\nless likely to vote for Trump in the early GOP primaries when\nRepublicans had several candidates to choose from.10 Among the\nmost devout, a plurality (39 percent) voted for Sen. Ted Cruz\n(R-TX) rather than Donald Trump (34 percent).11 However,\nTrump did best among those conservatives who never go to church,\ngarnering fully 69 percent of their votes in the early\nprimaries.\n\nHow many Trump voters attend church regularly? VOTER Survey data\nindicate that if church attendance does have a moderating effect on\nracial and immigration attitudes, it does so only for less than\nhalf of the Trump coalition. About a quarter (24 percent) of Trump\nvoters say they never attend religious services and another quarter\n(24 percent) say they seldom attend. Another 12 percent report\nattending a few times a year and 8 percent say they attend services\na few times a month. The remaining 31 percent attend church\nregularly, including 22 percent who participate weekly and 9\npercent who participate more than once a week.12\n\nTrump voters who attend church most frequently are more likely\nto identify as Protestant Christian than those who attend less\noften. Among Trump voters who attend church more than once a week,\nnearly three-fourths (73 percent) identify as Protestant, 18\npercent identify as Catholic, 4 percent identify as another form of\nChristianity (such as Mormonism), 4 percent identify with another\nreligion, and 2 percent don’t identify with a specific religious\nfaith. Among Trump voters who never attend religious services, a\nplurality (38 percent) don’t identify with any religious\ndenomination or faith tradition, 17 percent identify as atheist or\nagnostic, 18 percent as Catholic, 22 percent as Protestant, and 5\npercent as a member of another religion.\n\nInterestingly, churchgoing Trump voters don’t look much\ndifferent from their secular copartisans on a range of demographic\nvariables. They make about the same amount of money (although very\nfrequent churchgoers make somewhat less). They are about equally\nlikely to work full time (38 percent vs. 42 percent), although\nregular churchgoers are more likely to be retired. A similar\nproportion say they pay attention to the news and public affairs\n(64 percent vs. 62 percent). And they are both highly likely to be\nwhite (83 percent vs. 81 percent).\n\nHowever, there are a few differences. Weekly churchgoing Trump\nvoters are more likely than secular Trump voters to be married (70\npercent vs. 55 percent), to be female (47 percent vs. 39 percent),\nand to have graduated from college (31 percent vs. 19 percent).\nWeekly churchgoing Trump voters are also more likely to identify as\nconservative (80 percent vs. 57 percent) and Republican (65 percent\nvs. 51 percent) than their secular counterparts. Instead, secular\nTrump voters are more likely to identify as politically independent\n(41 percent vs. 28 percent) and moderate (35 percent vs. 17\npercent) than weekly churchgoing Trump voters.\nTaking these results together leaves us with a surprising\nfinding: conservative, Republican, churchgoing Trump voters take\nmore moderate positions on\nmany culture war issues than their self-identified moderate,\nindependent, nonchurchgoing counterparts.\n\n\nThe positive relationship between religious service attendance\nand tolerance examined in this report is simply a correlation. We\ndon’t know for sure if attending religious services causes people to become more tolerant\nand accepting of others with different backgrounds. But we can test\nwhether some other demographic variable — like education,\nincome, gender, or age — might be confounding these results.\nFor instance, perhaps more-educated conservatives are more likely\nto participate in civic institutions (such as churches) and also\nare more likely to take more moderate positions on some culture war\nissues. If this were true, we might draw the conclusion that\neducation drives these results more than religious participation\ndoes.\nTo examine this potential, we ran a statistical test (regression\nanalysis) using church attendance as a predictor of attitudes\ntoward racial and religious minorities while also taking into\naccount education, income, race, gender, and age. Even when\naccounting for these demographic factors, increased church\nattendance remains a significant predictor of more favorable\nattitudes toward black people, Hispanics, Asians, Jews, and Muslims\n(Appendix A). The statistical models predict increasingly favorable\nattitudes toward these populations as Trump voters attend religious\nservices more often, while holding other demographic factors\nconstant.\nNearly three-fourths (73 percent) of Trump voters identify as\neither Protestant or Catholic. Might participation in either of\nthese two faith traditions have different effects? Statistical\ntests suggest not. A series of tests comparing the impact of\nreligious attendance among white Protestant Trump voters and white\nCatholic Trump voters reveals that participation in either faith,\nin most instances, is a significant predictor of improved attitudes\ntoward racial and religious minorities.13\nFurthermore, these tests indicate that the small differences that\ndo exist are not statistically significant. Trump voters who attend\neither Protestant or Catholic religious services weekly are more\nlikely than their secular counterparts to have warm feelings toward\nthose population groups (Appendix B).\nWhat about other faith traditions? As there were few Trump\nvoters who identified with religious traditions other than\nProtestant and Catholic, we expanded the analysis to encompass all\nrespondents in order to examine the relationship between\nparticipation in other religious faiths and tolerance. Weekly\nparticipation in these religious traditions also significantly\npredicts more tolerant attitudes. For instance, Muslims who attend\nreligious services regularly are significantly more likely to have\nfavorable attitudes toward Christians, white people, black people,\nHispanics, and Asians.14 Churchgoing Mormons are also\nsignificantly more likely to have favorable attitudes toward black\npeople, Hispanics, Asians, Jews, Muslims, and immigrants. These\nfindings indicate that it is not one particular religious\ndenomination or faith tradition but rather religious participation\nof some kind that may promote social tolerance.\nTo be sure, conservatives who attend church regularly don’t take\nthe same positions as liberals on most of these issues. For\ninstance, churchgoing Trump voters are less likely to have warm\nfeelings toward Muslims (27 percent) than are Hillary Clinton’s\n2016 voters (66 percent). Churchgoing Trump voters are also more\nlikely than Clinton voters to say immigration should be more\ndifficult (48 percent vs. 21 percent), to oppose offering a pathway\nto citizenship (51 percent vs. 11 percent), to say illegal\nimmigrants are a drain on society (61 percent vs. 10 percent), and\nto be frustrated with language barriers (29 percent vs. 7\npercent).\nAlthough churchgoing Trump voters are relatively more opposed to\nthe death penalty than their secular counterparts are, more than\ntwo-thirds (68 percent) support it compared with about one-third\n(36 percent) of Clinton voters. And, even though an overwhelming\nmajority (81 percent) of Trump-voting churchgoers say poverty is an\nimportant issue, that figure still falls short of the 97 percent of\nClinton voters who feel similarly.\nThere are a few exceptions, however, in which churchgoing Trump\nvoters coalesce with Clinton voters. In particular, both groups\nhave similarly warm feelings toward racial minorities and Jews, and\nthey have similar attitudes about trade.\nEven so, Trump voters, regardless of religious participation,\ntake more conservative positions than do Clinton voters on most\nissues. Thus, attending church regularly does not turn\nconservatives into liberals. However, religious attendance may pull\nconservatives in a liberal direction on key cultural issues\npolarizing the nation.\nWhat is it about attending weekly religious services that might\ncause conservatives to take more moderate positions on immigration,\nrace, trade, and other issues than those of less-devout\nconservatives?15\nFirst, many religious teachings specifically call for compassion\nand kindness. Given that 93 percent of religiously observant Trump\nvoters identify as Christian, it is relevant to note biblical\nteachings, such as those in John 15:12: “This is my commandment,\nthat you love one another as I have loved you.”\nSecond, perhaps religious participation instills in churchgoers\na sense of personal agency and a belief in a just world. By\nextension, they may feel less inclined to blame “out-groups” for\nthe challenges they face. Indeed, the survey shows that churchgoers\nare less likely to believe they live in a dog-eat-dog world and are\nmore likely to believe that the system is fair. For instance, the\nmore frequently Trump voters attend church, the more likely they\nare to believe they have a say in politics, to believe the economic\nsystem is fair, and to believe that most people try to be helpful\nrather than look out for themselves or take advantage of others. If\nchurchgoers are less likely to feel as though they are victims,\nperhaps they are also less likely to blame external sources for the\nchallenges they face in their lives.\n\n\n\n\nThird, religious institutions provide communities that people\ncan belong to that are not based on their race or nationality.\nThus, members do not need to rely on immutable traits such as race,\nethnicity, or nation of birth to feel that they are part of\nsomething bigger than themselves. Research shows that conservatives\nplace greater emphasis on being loyal to a community than do\nliberals.16 And so, feeling disconnected from a\nmeaningful community may lead some conservatives to seek belonging\non the basis of their race or the nation. Doing so increases\nexclusivity and divisiveness, and it exacerbates racial and\nnativist tensions.\nIndeed, we find religious people seem to feel more connected in\ntheir communities. The more frequently Trump voters attend\nreligious services, the more satisfied they report being with the\nplace where they live, their neighborhood, and their family\nrelationships. For instance, very devout Trump voters are about 15\npercentage points more likely than nonreligious Trump voters to\nfeel satisfied with their communities and family relationships.\nConsistent with this pattern, religious Trump voters are more\nlikely to feel comfortable and at home in the United States, while\nsecular Trump voters feel like strangers. Although 58 percent of\nsecular Trump voters agree that “these days I feel like a stranger\nin my own country,” almost the same share (55 percent) of religious\nTrump voters disagree.\n\n\nThe results of this analysis indicate that religious\nparticipation may have a moderating effect on our politics,\nparticularly on matters of race, immigration, and identity. They\nfurther suggest that private institutions in civil society —\noutside the domain of government and public policy — may\nserve an important function in reducing polarization and racial\ntensions and in helping people find common ground. However, several\nimportant forces may diminish these possible effects.\nFirst, partisanship may lessen the differences between religious\nand nonreligious conservatives as they unify behind President\nTrump. For instance, Trump’s executive order restricting travel to\nthe United States from several Muslim-majority countries and his\nnegative trade rhetoric may override the natural differences that\nemerge between religious and nonreligious conservatives. Thus, in\nsome circumstances the president may reduce the effect of religious\nparticipation on people’s opinions about key cultural issues.\nSecond, record numbers of people are leaving organized religion.\nData from the Public Religion Research Institute finds that, since\n1992, the number of people leaving their faith traditions has\nquadrupled among the general public and tripled among\nconservatives.17 Thus, a potential moderating force\namong conservatives has been receding. Research has found that\nconservatives tend to care more than liberals do about being a part\nof, and loyal to, a community.18 But as conservatives withdraw from\nreligious participation, they may redraw the boundaries of their\ngroup identity along the lines of immutable traits such as\nethnicity and nation of birth rather than something people can\nchoose. For instance, this could potentially bolster support for\nwhite nationalism and the so-called alt-right movement.\n\nThird, as many people view religious institutions through the\nlens of the LGBT culture wars, they overlook and thus dismiss these\ncivil institutions as a possible source of tolerance and moderation\non other issues. They incorrectly assume that if religious people\nare less accepting of sexual minorities, they must also feel less\nfavorable toward racial and religious minorities. In addition, many\ncritical of religious affiliation may assert that plenty of\nnonreligious people are tolerant of diversity, making religious\nparticipation seem unnecessary to foster tolerance — but that\nphenomenon is found primarily on the left. Many people have not\nconsidered whether religious observance has differing effects among\nconservatives and liberals. Thus, some view religious participation\nas being both unhelpful and pernicious to the cause of tolerance\nand social harmony. This view is further reflected and promoted\nthrough popular culture and entertainment that depict religious\nconservatives as villainous or backward. Some may hope that\nencouraging conservatives to disengage from religion will make them\nmore tolerant. However, these data provide some indication they may\nnot become more tolerant, but rather they may become intolerant of\ndifferent groups.\nIn sum, a force that may moderate conservatives on certain\nissues and reduce polarization is on the decline, and popular\nculture is reaffirming the trend. But if interpretation of these\ndata is any guide, doing so may backfire. While it may be true that\ndeclining religious participation has calmed the culture wars over\nmoral traditionalism and LGBT rights, that change may also come at\nthe expense of fueling deeper resentment along the lines of race,\nethnicity, and nativity. While government certainly should have no\nrole in promoting religion, these data indicate that there may be\nunexpected negative consequences should government or popular\nculture be used with the intent to diminish people’s ability or\ndesire to participate in religious traditions.\nPredicting favorability toward specific racial and\nreligious groups among Trump voters\n\nNote: Favorability toward each group is predicted\nusing a 0 to 100 feeling thermometer. Models estimated via ordinary\nleast squares regression with standard errors in parenthesis.\n* p ≤ 0.05; ** p ≤ 0.01; *** p ≤ 0.001\nThis table shows statistical model estimates predicting\nfavorability toward black people, Hispanics, Asians, Jews, and\nMuslims, respectively, using a “feeling thermometer,” which asks\nrespondents to rate their feelings toward the following groups\nusing a scale of 0 to 100, where 0 means they feel very cold and\nunfavorable and 100 means they feel very warm and favorable toward\nthe group. All variables are coded so that higher values indicate\nmore favorable feelings toward each of the respective groups. These\nmodels show that greater church attendance significantly predicts\nmore favorable attitudes toward black people, Hispanics, Asians,\nJews, and Muslims even when taking into account the effects of\nother variables.\nThis report is based on the Voter Study Group 2016, 2017, and\n2018 VOTER Survey (Views of the Electorate Research Survey). In\npartnership with the survey firm YouGov, the 2018 VOTER Survey\ninterviewed 6,005 Americans between April 5 and May 14, 2018. Of\nthose respondents, 4,705 had been interviewed previously and 1,300\nwere part of an additional sample of 18- to 24-year-olds and\nHispanics.\n\n\n1 The share of Americans who\nworry about race relations has doubled since 2014 (17 percent to 37\npercent), and the number very dissatisfied with the state of race\nrelations has tripled (11 percent to 36 percent); “Race Relations,”\nIn Depth Topics A to Z, Gallup News website, https://news.gallup.com/poll/1687/race-relations.aspx.\nSee also Betsy Cooper et al., “Anxiety, Nostalgia, and Mistrust:\nFindings from the 2015 American Values Survey,” PRRI report, Public\nReligion Research Institute, November 2015, \nhttps://www.prri.org/research/survey-anxiety-nostalgia-and-mistrust-findings-from-the-2015-american-values-survey/.\n2 Data in this brief come from\nthe Democracy Fund Voter Study Group’s 2018, 2017, and 2016 VOTER\nSurveys.\n3 In contrast, far fewer\nRepublicans (10 percent) and independents (38 percent) have\nunfavorable views of evangelical Christians.\n4 This study examines Trump\nvoters of all racial backgrounds. The racial composition of Trump\nvoters does not vary considerably by church attendance. For\ninstance, 84 percent of Trump voters who attend church more than\nonce a week are white as are 81 percent of those who never attend\nreligious services. Therefore, more favorable attitudes toward\nracial minorities among very devout Trump voters are not due to a\nsignificantly more diverse pool of religious Trump voters.\n5 Majorities of Trump voters\nregardless of religious attendance support the travel ban either\n“strongly” or “somewhat,” including 67 percent among Trump voters\nwho attend church more than weekly and 83 percent among those who\nnever attend.\n6 Among all Trump voters, 80\npercent oppose denying Muslims who are U.S. citizens the right to\nvote, compared with 92 percent of Hillary Clinton voters.\n7 Data on volunteering come from\nthe panel baseline survey of the 2012 Cooperative Campaign Analysis\nProject (CCAP) merged with the VOTER surveys.\n8 “Election 2016 Exit Polls,” CNN\nPolitics, November 2016, \nhttps://www.cnn.com/election/2016/results/exit-polls/national/president.\n9 “Election 2016 Exit Polls,” CNN\nPolitics. See also “2012 Election Center-President: Full Results,”\nCNN Politics, December 2012, http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/results/race/president/.\n10 Early primaries are\ncategorized as the first 10 days that GOP primaries were held.\n11 Support for Ted Cruz may have\nbeen higher than this, given that the 2016 VOTER Survey was\nadministered after Trump had already secured the nomination and\nthus respondents may have wanted to say they voted for the\nwinner.\n12 It should be noted that\nresearch shows survey respondents often overreport their level of\nchurch attendance. See Daniel Cox, Robert P. Jones, and Juhem\nNavarro-Rivera, “I Know What You Did Last Sunday: Measuring Social\nDesirability Bias in Self-Reported Religious Behavior, Belief, and\nIdentity,” PRRI report, Public Religion Research Institute, May 17,\n2014, https://prri.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/AAPOR-2014-Final.pdf.\n13 Among white Trump voters,\nCatholic church attendance significantly predicted more favorable\nattitudes toward black people and Jews, as well as immigrants at\nthe p ≤ .05 level and toward Hispanics and Asians at the p ≤ .10\nlevel. It did not significantly predict more favorable attitudes\ntoward Muslims. Protestant church attendance among white Trump\nvoters significantly predicted more favorable attitudes toward\nblack people, Hispanics, Asians, Jews, Muslims, and immigrants.\nThese differences may be, in part, the consequence of there being\nfewer white Catholic Trump voters (n = 733) than white Protestant\nTrump voters (n = 1,532) surveyed; with a lower number, there is\nless certainty regarding the estimates of white Catholic Trump\nvoters’ attitudes.\n14 Because of small sample sizes\none should use caution when interpreting these results. In the\nsurvey, Muslims: n = 21; Mormons: n = 133; Buddhist and Hindu: n =\n72.\n15 For a discussion of academic\nstudies on the role of religious devotion in tolerance, see Kenneth\nD.
