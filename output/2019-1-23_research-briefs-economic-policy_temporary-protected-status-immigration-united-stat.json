  "content": "\nDiscussions of immigration policy and reform in the United\nStates over the last 40 years almost always focus on Congressional\ngridlock and inaction. Despite the salience of immigration in\npublic opinion polls and despite innumerable legislative proposals,\nCongress has largely shied away from the issue, passing no\ncomprehensive immigration reform legislation since the early 1990s.\nWith Congress stuck at an immigration impasse for years,\npresidential administrations from both parties have taken crucial\nactions that regulate both inflows of new immigrants and the status\nof immigrants already in the United States. While these actions\nreceive little scholarly attention, executive actions on\nimmigration have a long history, and may have widereaching and\nunexpected (or unintended) consequences.\nExecutive actions on immigration to the United States have a\nlong and rich history. Every president in the post- World War II\nera has deployed blanket protections for immigrant groups facing\nhardship. With Congress unwilling to act, President Truman issued\nexecutive grants of relief following World War II for groups\ntargeted and displaced by Nazi Germany. Kennedy extended and\nexpanded protections to Cubans due to the Cuban Revolution. Carter\nsuspended deportation proceedings for 250,000 Silva letter-holders\nin 1977 and Reagan provided a similar protection for 200,000\nNicaraguan refugees in 1987. President H. W. Bush continued this\ntradition of shielding individuals from deportation by extending\nReagan’s “family fairness” policy to 100,000\nspouses in 1990, and Bill Clinton similarly halted deportation\nproceedings for 40,000 Haitians in 1997 over concerns about\npolitical instability in that island nation.\nThese actions, when applied to all noncitizens present in the\nUnited States, are a form of relief called Extended Voluntary\nDeparture (EVD). Unlike refugee status- which, as defined by the\nUnited Nations 1951 Refugee Convention, provides protection to\nindividuals fearing persecution-EVD provides blanket coverage to\nall noncitizens present in the United States in the event that\ntheir country experiences a natural disaster, civil conflict, or\nother humanitarian crisis. The application of EVD is optional: in\npractice, the Secretary of State makes a case to the Attorney\nGeneral that the conditions in a particular country would place\nreturning foreign nationals at risk. The Attorney General, in turn,\nissues what amounts to a form of prosecutorial discretion that\ndirects immigration authorities to not pursue deportation\nproceedings against individuals from the country in question.\nBetween 1960 and 1990, EVD was granted to foreign nationals from 16\ncountries. President George H. W. Bush used his executive authority\nto provide a similar kind of relief-known as Deferred Enforced\nDeparture (DED)-to Chinese nationals after the Tiananmen Square\nMassacre in 1989.\nOver the course of the 1980s, members of Congress and the public\nat large grew concerned about what they viewed as the arbitrary-and\nincreasingly political-use of EVD and DED. Most noticeably,\nconcerns over the Reagan administration’s refusal to grant El\nSalvadorians either refugee status or EVD led to congressional\naction, which culminated in the Immigration Act of 1990.\nEstablished by Congress, the Immigration Act of 1990 grants\nTemporary Protective Status (TPS) to foreign nationals from nations\nexperiencing excessively difficult living conditions but who do not\nqualify as refugees. These conditions may be borne from natural\ndisaster, political and economic instability, or violent conflict.\nManaged by the Secretary of Homeland Security but in close\nconsultation with the president, TPS offers two critical benefits\nto foreign nationals: a temporary shielding from deportation\nproceedings (even if the migrant arrived in the United States\nillegally) and legal access to the formal labor market. TPS is\ninitially granted for two years and can be renewed indefinitely,\nbut TPS can also be terminated at the discretion of the executive\nbranch. Executive actions by President Trump and current Secretary\nof Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen made this clear when they\nended TPS protections for more than 400,000 immigrants from El\nSalvador, Honduras, Haiti, Nicaragua, Sudan, and Nepal.\nWhat are the consequences of TPS for immigration to the United\nStates? Surprisingly, there is no scholarship on this question. In\nour research, we exploit the fact that migrants who hold TPS\nreceive access to the formal US labor market regardless of their\nlegal status. Labor market access allows migrants to obtain\nemployment opportunities that, on average, pay higher wages than if\nthey did not have formal labor market access. In line with models\nfrom the new economics of labor migration that conceive of\nmigration as a household risk diversification strategy, we expect\nTPS holders who have obtained higher-paying jobs to remit more\nmoney home to their friends and family than they would without TPS.\nThese remittances increase household incomes in crisis-affected\ncountries, reducing the propensity for other household members to\nmigrate for economic opportunity. And we show, both theoretically\nand empirically, that this increase in remittances decreases the\ndemand for migration-both legal and illegal-into the United\nStates.\nNOTE:\nThis research brief is based on David Leblang, Benjamin Helms,\nAlexa Iadarola, Ankita Satpathy, Kelsey Hunt, Rebecca Brough, Eric\nXu, and Mahesh Rao, “Temporary Protected Status and\nImmigration to the United States,” June 2018, https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3206009.\n"
