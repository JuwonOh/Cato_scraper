  "content": "\nSince taking office in 2017, President Trump has expanded\ninterior immigration enforcement, made it easier for states and\nlocal governments to apprehend and detain illegal immigrants, and\nargued that building a wall is essential to reducing crime. These\nactions are largely based on the perception that illegal immigrants\nare a significant and disproportionate source of crime in the\nUnited States. This brief uses American Community Survey data from\nthe U.S. Census to analyze incarcerated immigrants according to\ntheir citizenship and legal status in 2017. The data show that all\nimmigrants—legal and illegal—are less likely to be\nincarcerated than native-born Americans relative to their shares of\nthe population. By themselves, illegal immigrants are less likely\nto be incarcerated than native-born Americans.\n",
