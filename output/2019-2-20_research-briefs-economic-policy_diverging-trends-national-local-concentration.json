This is because the\ntransportation of goods and people is costly, so firms set up\nproduction plants, distribution centers, and stores close to\ncustomers. A coffee shop or restaurant in Manhattan does not\ncompete with similar establishments in Seattle, and probably not\neven in Brooklyn. The wedge in prices or costs created by the\ninconvenience of buying a product far away from the desired\nconsumption point shields companies in different locations from\ndirect competition. Of course, the size of these costs, and\ntherefore the geographic extent of the market, varies by product.\nMarkets are also product-specific. Producers of a particular\nproduct are shielded from competition by producers of distinct but\nrelated goods and services to the degree that their consumption\nrequires households to move away from their ideal variety. Much has\nbeen written recently\nMuch has been written recently about the increase in national\nmarket concentration observed over the last two decades and the\nrole that large national firms have played in driving this trend.\nThe evidence for the rise in concentration is uncontroversial; the\nshare of the largest firms and the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index,\namong other measures of concentration, have increased consistently\nin most sectors since 1990. A narrative has emerged whereby this\nincrease in national concentration is perceived as the cause of\nlower product-market competition. This fall in competition is then\nviewed as the culprit of other apparent trends, such as rising\nmarkups and market power, the increasing profits of large firms,\ndeclining labor market dynamism and firm entry, and a declining\nlabor share. All these trends—and particularly those related\nto concentration, markups, and profits—point to the notion\nthat market power has been increasing. While the empirical\nrobustness and validity of some of these trends have been contested\nin recent work, the rise in national market concentration remains\ntheir main empirical foundation.\nWe document four main facts regarding national and local\nproduct-market concentration in the U.S. economy between 1990 and\n2014. We make use of the National Establishment Time Series (NETS)\ndataset, which covers the universe of U.S. firms and their plants.\nThe dataset includes sales and employment numbers for plants at\ndifferent levels of geographical and industrial disaggregation.\nOur first fact is that the observed positive trend in market\nconcentration at the national level has been accompanied by a\ncorresponding negative trend in average local market concentration.\nWe observe an increase in concentration at the national level\nacross the vast majority of sectors and industries but a fall in\nconcentration when it is measured at the core-based statistical\narea, county, or ZIP code levels. The narrower the geographic\ndefinition, the faster the decline in local concentration. This is\nmeaningful because the relevant definition of concentration from\nwhich to infer changes in competition is, in most sectors, local\nand not national.\nThe second fact shows that local concentration is falling across\na range of industries that together account for 77 percent of\nemployment and 70 percent of sales. Furthermore, in industries\nwhere national concentration is rising, industries where local\nconcentration has declined account for the majority of employment\noverall (70 percent of employment and 65 percent of sales) across\nall major sectors. The presence of these diverging trends is always\nlarge, but it is more pronounced in services; retail trade; and\nfinance, insurance, and real estate relative to wholesale trade and\nmanufacturing. This ordering is natural given that transport costs\nare less relevant in the latter two sectors. Together, these first\ntwo facts underscore an unmistakable decline in local concentration\nthat is pervasive across all sectors.\nHow does one reconcile a positive trend in national\nconcentration with a negative trend in local concentration? Our\nthird fact shows that, among the industries that exhibit this\npattern, top firms have accelerated these trends. That is,\nexcluding the top firm in each industry (in terms of national sales\nin their industry in 2014), the national increase in concentration\nnaturally becomes less pronounced. Perhaps more surprisingly, the\ndecline in local concentration also becomes less pronounced. Put\nanother way, while large firms have materially contributed to the\nobserved increase in national concentration, they have also\ncontributed to the observed decline in local concentration. Among\nindustries with diverging trends, large firms have become bigger,\nbut the associated geographic expansion of these firms, through the\nopening of more plants in new local markets, has lowered local\nconcentration, which suggests increased local competition. In the\nconsiderably smaller set of industries where we observe increases\nin both national and local concentration, top firms have also been\nresponsible for increases in both forms of concentration.\nOur fourth fact establishes that, among industries with falling\nlocal concentration, the opening of a plant by a top firm is\nassociated with a decline in local concentration at the time of the\nopening and that this lower level of concentration persists for at\nleast the next seven years. This observation provides further\nevidence that, in those industries, large enterprises do not enter\nand dominate the local market but instead lower its concentration,\neither by competing with the previous local monopolist or simply by\nadding one more establishment that grabs a proportional market\nshare from other local establishments. In any case, the notion that\nentry by large firms eliminates local producers to the point of\nincreasing concentration is certainly not supported in the vast\nmajority of industries where most U.S. employment resides.\nConsider the much-publicized case of Walmart. Most of Walmart’s\nestablishments are in the discount department store industry, an\nindustry with increasing national concentration and declining local\nconcentration. Consistent with fact four, when Walmart opens a\nstore, concentration falls in the associated ZIP code. In contrast,\nwhen computing the concentration without considering the opening\nWalmart establishment, concentration remains constant. One can also\nconsider the effect of Walmart on the number of firms in a local\nmarket. When Walmart enters, the total number of establishments in\nthe ZIP code increases, though by less than one-to-one (about 3/4).\nIn other words, Walmart generates some exit, but the net result of\nopening a Walmart store is a greater number of competitors in the\nmarket for at least seven years after entry. This case is\nparadigmatic, but there are many others across all major sectors.\nFor example, the expansion of Cemex, the top firm by sales in 2014\nin the ready-mixed concrete industry, led to a similar decline in\nlocal concentration and an expansion in the local number of\nestablishments in the industry.\nOur findings challenge the view that product-market\nconcentration is increasing in the United States. They do so not by\nchallenging the evidence that national concentration has\nincreased—we actually provide additional evidence for that\neffect across many industries—but by observing that this\nnational trend does not imply a positive local trend in\nconcentration. In fact, we show that it implies the opposite in\nmost industries: a declining trend in concentration. Ultimately,\nconcentration matters because it can lead to less competition.\nHence measures of concentration must be aligned with product\nmarkets, as well as their geographic and industrial scope. In\nparticular, for the majority of industries, concentration is likely\nmore relevant to firm pricing and other strategic behavior at the\nlocal level. Our findings are also consistent with the mixed\nevidence found in recent literature regarding secular changes in\nmarkups across individual industries. If local competition matters,\nwe should not see increases in markups or profits in the markets\nwhere local competition is increasing. The measurement of markups\nin local markets associated with particular industries depends on\nimportant assumptions and requires very detailed data. The NETS\ndata does not allow us to calculate these local statistics, but\nthere exists evidence of flat markups over time in specific\nindustries with declining concentration and in the aggregate.\nThe facts we document are directly relevant to the design of\nantitrust policy and other policies that can prevent successful\nfirms from growing at the national level. We document heterogenous\ntrends across industries, and in some industries, concentration is\nclearly rising both at the national and local level. However, our\nresults should provide pause for policymakers who worry about\nincreases in market power. In most industries, large firms are\nlowering local concentration, and therefore most likely increasing\nproduct market competition. Carl Shapiro, a former deputy assistant\nattorney general at the Antitrust Division of the Department of\nJustice and member of the Council of Economic Advisers under Barack\nObama, makes a similar argument. Discussing evidence of the\npositive trend in national market concentration, he observes:\n“So, while these data do reflect the fact that large, national\nfirms have captured an increasing share of overall revenue during\nthe past 20 years in many of these 893 ‘industries,’ they do not,\nin and of themselves, indicate that the relevant local markets have\nbecome more concentrated.” We provide empirical evidence\nsupporting the notion that, in the face of rising national\nconcentration, local markets have indeed become, on average,\nsignificantly less concentrated.\nNOTE:\nThis research brief is based on Esteban Rossi-Hansberg, Pierre-\nDaniel Sarte, and Nicholas Trachter, “Diverging Trends in\nNational and Local Concentration,” NBER Working Paper no.\n25066, September 2018, http://www.nber.org/papers/w25066.\n",
