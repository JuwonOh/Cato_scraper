  "content": "\n“Market failure” is a common justification for new\ngovernment policies. Proponents of interventions love to point to\ninstances of apparently imperfect markets and assume that\ngovernment taxation, subsidies, and regulation can seamlessly\nperfect them, thus maximizing social welfare.\nAcademic economists have long doubted this way of thinking.\nComparing market outcomes to some unattainable and unidentifiable\nideal is not useful in a world of imperfect knowledge and\ngovernment failure. It is far better to compare outcomes from an\nintervention against actual realistic alternatives. Yet public\ndebate often seems stuck on this rudimentary understanding of what\nmarket failure is and how it should be dealt with.\nWorse, in many instances this basic framework of market failure\nis misused, leading to misguided policies. Government services, for\nexample, are often labeled public goods even when they do not\nfulfill economists’ definition of public goods as being\nnonrivalrous and nonexcludable, and in situations where markets\nhave clearly found means of delivery without government. This\ncreates the public perception that some goods and services must be\nprovided by government simply because they are or could be.\nLikewise, proponents of Pigouvian taxation to address negative\nexternalities often exaggerate how high these taxes should be by\nincluding private costs (such as lost productivity) as external\ncosts, failing to apply the logic of dealing with externalities\nconsistently, and ignoring how taxes affect the demand for\nsubstitute products, which themselves can generate negative\nexternalities. Externality arguments are also often used to justify\nuniform consumption taxes even when only certain consumption levels\ngenerate the external costs, and they are increasingly used to\njustify outright bans on various goods. Both responses can lower\nsocial welfare.\n"
