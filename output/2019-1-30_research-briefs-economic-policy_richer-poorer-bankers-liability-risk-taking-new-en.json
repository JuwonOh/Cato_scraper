  "content": "\nBanks carry large debts relative to capital, largely in the form\nof deposits. At the same time, owners and management face limited\nliability. As such, they can cash in on a bank’s profits while\nshifting losses to depositors and other debt holders. This\nencourages risk-taking, contrary to the interests of depositors\nand, potentially, society as a whole. Lawmakers have been aware of\nthis moral hazard problem for as long as deposit-taking banks have\nexisted. In response, they used to force bank owners—which\ngenerally included managers— to shoulder significant downside\nrisk. For example, during much of the 19th century, bank\nshareholders in the UK faced unlimited liability. In the US, most\nfaced “double liability,” which became the norm after the\nBanking Act of 1863. For each dollar invested in the bank,\nshareholders could lose two dollars. Double liability fell out of\nfashion after the Great Depression and was largely abolished in the\nUS by 1933.\nThe 2008 crisis has sparked renewed interest in the question of\nhow much downside risk bankers should bear. Some view bank\nmanagers’ limited liability, or their lack of “skin in the\ngame,” as one of the culprits of the crisis. Many commentators\nargue that the financial sector would be more stable if bank\nmanagers shouldered more downside risk and have called for the\nreintroduction of more stringent liability rules. For example, past\nbonuses could be “clawed back” if a bank suffers a loss.\nAt the same time, it is not obvious that increasing managers’\nliability will effectively reduce banks’ risk-taking. Reputational\nconcerns, the fear of losing bankspecific human capital, and active\nmonitoring by depositors and other stakeholders may be sufficient\nto curb risky behavior, rendering such a measure redundant.\nDespite interest in the topic and its relevance for policy,\nthere is little direct evidence that increasing the liability of\nbank managers reduces risk. In recent years, bank managers’\nliability has generally been limited, and it is difficult to\nobserve the counterfactual. Commentators often point to the fact\nthat investment banks, traditionally partnerships with unlimited\nliability, became much riskier in the 1980s when\nthey went public. However, this evidence is largely anecdotal,\nbased on a limited number of observations, and coincides with a\nperiod of general financial deregulation. More recently, there are\ndifferences across banks in the degree to which managers’\ncompensation depends on the share price, but this primarily affects\nmanagers’ upside, as shares have limited liability and banks are\nhighly levered. As a result, high sensitivity to the bank’s share\nprice is usually associated with more risk-taking, not less.\nWe evaluate the extent to which historically stricter liability\nrules for bank managers were effective at reducing risk. We focus\non a setting in which we observe plausibly exogenous variation in\nbank managers’ downside exposure. We study banks in New England\nbetween 1867 and 1880. At the time, bank CEOs (presidents) owned a\nlarge fraction of their banks’ shares, which carried double\nliability. If a bank failed, unable to repay creditors, the\nComptroller of the Currency could seize additional assets from\nshareholders up to the value of the initially paid-in capital. This\nperiod intersects with a major change in the marital property\nregime. Under the existing common law, ownership of women’s\nproperty transferred to their husbands upon marriage. Starting in\nthe 1840s, states in New England introduced Married Women’s\nProperty Acts (MWPAs) that allowed newly married women to retain\nseparate ownership over their property. This introduces variation\nin the downside exposure faced by bank presidents. If a president\nwas married before the enactment of an MWPA, all of his family’s\nassets were at stake; if he was married after, his wife’s separate\nassets were protected. The larger the proportion of household\nassets standing in the wife’s name, the more protection was\nafforded. We investigate whether a bank president took more risk if\nhe faced less downside exposure. We measure risk through (1)\nleverage, (2) the propensity to “evergreen” loans, (3)\nthe propensity to make loans in violation of regulation, and (4) ex\npost losses of capital and deposits. Importantly, we can measure\nthe impact of limited liability on risk-taking, keeping constant\nthe regulatory environment, time, and place.\nThe context that we consider differs from today in two key\ndimensions: in the 1860s and 1870s there was no deposit insurance,\nand banks were too small to be considered “too big to\nfail.” This means that moral hazard problems induced by\n(implicit) government guarantees only played a marginal role.\nMoreover, individual depositors had a clear incentive to monitor\nthe banks themselves and exert discipline on the banks’ management.\nRather than a weakness, we see this as a strength of our analysis.\nWe are able to isolate the effect of bank managers’ liability on\nbank behavior absent bailout expectations and under close scrutiny\nof depositors.\nOur evidence indicates that reducing bankers’ liability\nincreased risk-taking. Banks managed by presidents married after an\nMWPA had more leverage, were more likely to evergreen loans and\nviolate lending rules, and lost more capital and deposits in the\nDepression of 1873-1878. We document that the effect is stronger\nfor bank presidents married to richer women. Variation in the\nmarital property regime under which a bank president was married\ncomes from four sources: (1) different timing of states introducing\nan MWPA, (2) the banker’s age, (3) the timing of the banker’s first\nmarriage, and (4) possible remarriage after the death of an earlier\nspouse (divorce was rare). States introduced the MWPAs at different\npoints in time, and bankers tended to get married at different\nages. That means that we can simultaneously include fixed effects\nfor (1) the state (or county) a bank president lived in, (2) age\nand (3) age at first marriage. Doing so, we difference out any\nspurious effects coming from a banker’s age or state of residence,\nas well as a banker’s decision to marry later in life. We do not\ndifference out variation coming from remarriage, as this generally\noccurred if the banker’s first wife died, which we view as\nexogenous.\nWe also explore the real effects of increasing bankers’\nliability. It is not obvious that reining in risk-taking is\nsocially optimal if this leads to underinvestment in risky projects\nwith positive net present value. We investigate this issue using a\nsample of about 1,000 firms from the 1870 Census of Manufacturers.\nWe study the decision to introduce a new technology in need of high\nup-front investment: steam power. We find that firms in counties\nwith more banking capital are more likely to use steam power.\nHowever, it makes no difference whether this bank capital is\nmanaged by presidents married before or after an MWPA.\nNOTE:\nThis research brief is based on Peter Koudijs, Laura Salisbury, and\nGurpal Sran, “For Richer, for Poorer: Bankers’ Liability and\nRisk- Taking in New England, 1867-1880,” NBER Working Paper\nno.24998, September 2018, https://www.nber.org/papers/w24998.\n"
